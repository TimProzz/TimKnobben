Tim Knobben - Web and software developer

Here you can find the source code for my website https://www.timknobben.nl/.

A few notes for somebody importing the website:
* This site has a database which can be found in the DATABASE folder. Just import the .sql file and you're done with that!

* The database connection has been set for localhost. If you're planning on renaming the database or changing the login details, here are the original details: 
  DB servername = "localhost"
  DB username   = "root"
  DB password   = ""
  Database name = "u29719p23510_tim1"
 
* This site has a contact form that requires a Google reCAPTCHA key (in templates/footer-template.php). 
The key can be found/generated here: https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin
